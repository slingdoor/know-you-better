I've tried some breathing exercises but they don't seem to help much. I also tried studying more, but that just makes me more anxious because I realize how much I don't know.

I really don't want to fail these exams, but I feel like my anxiety is getting in the way of my preparation. Any advice would be really appreciated.`,

      title: 'Daily meditation changed my life - sharing my experience',
      content: `I started doing 10 minutes of meditation every morning about 6 months ago, and it has made such a difference in my anxiety levels. I wanted to share some beginner-friendly apps and techniques that worked for me.

**What I tried:**
- Headspace (great for beginners)
- Insight Timer (free with lots of options)
- Simple breathing exercises
- Body scan meditations

**What I noticed:**
- Less racing thoughts in the morning
- Better sleep quality
- More patience with stressful situations
- Improved focus during the day

I know meditation isn't for everyone, but if you're curious, I'd recommend starting with just 5 minutes. The key is consistency rather than duration.

Happy to answer any questions about getting started!`,
